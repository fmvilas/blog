### What Is This and Why Should You Use It?

When you have multiple candidates for your first EDA pilot project, it's easy to get stuck in endless debates. One person is passionate about Project A because it's a technical challenge, while another champions Project B because it fixes a personal headache. The **Pilot Project Selection Matrix** is a simple tool to move that conversation from being based on opinion to being based on objective, strategic criteria.

This isn't about doing math for the sake of it. It's a mechanism to force you and your team to have the right conversations *before* you commit. It makes your decision-making process transparent and defensible. When someone later asks, "Why did you pick this project?", you can show them a reasoned, collaborative analysis instead of just saying, "It felt like the right one."

### The Matrix Explained

The matrix is a simple table where you score potential projects against a set of weighted criteria.

* **Project Candidates (Rows):** These are the potential pilot projects you are considering.
* **Criteria (Columns):** These are the attributes you've decided are important for a successful pilot. These should be based on the principles in Strategy 7.
* **Weight (for each criterion):** This is the crucial part. Not all criteria are created equal. You must decide, as a team, how important each criterion is. For example, "Business Impact" might be twice as important as "Team Enthusiasm." We assign a weight (e.g., from 1 to 5) to each criterion.
* **Score (for each project against each criterion):** For each project, you give it a score (typically 1-5) on how well it meets each criterion.
* **Total Score:** For each project, the final score is calculated by multiplying its score in each criterion by that criterion's weight, and then summing the results. The formula is:
    $$\text{Total Score} = \sum (\text{Criterion Score} \times \text{Criterion Weight})$$

The project with the highest total score is your strongest candidate.

### The Template

Here is a template you can copy and adapt.

### How to Use It: A Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Step 1: Brainstorm Candidates.** Get your team and key stakeholders to list 2-4 serious candidates for the pilot project.
2.  **Step 2: Agree on Criteria and Weights.** This is the most important meeting. Sit down with the core team and decide on your criteria and their weights. *Do this before you start scoring*. This ensures everyone agrees on what "good" looks like. The template above is a good starting point, but feel free to adapt it.
3.  **Step 3: Score the Projects.** Go through each project one by one and have the group agree on a score (1-5) for each criterion. This will spark debateâ€”that's the point! You'll be forced to discuss, for example, *how* visible Project A really is.
4.  **Step 4: Calculate and Discuss.** Tally up the scores. Look at the result. The highest score is the logical winner, but don't treat it as a dictator. Use it as the centerpiece of a final discussion. Is everyone comfortable with the outcome? Does it feel right? The matrix provides data, but the final decision is still a human one.

### Examples in the Wild

#### Example 1: E-commerce Company

**Problem:** The company struggles with overselling popular items during flash sales because the inventory system is a slow, nightly batch job.

**Matrix:**

**Outcome:** The "Real-time Inventory Sync" wins by a large margin. Even though its scope is more complex than the notification service, its immense business impact and visibility make it the clear strategic choice.

#### Example 2: FinTech Company

**Problem:** The company needs to improve its backend processing to support faster product launches.

**Matrix:**

**Outcome:** Here, the project with the highest raw business impact, "Loan Origination Rewrite," loses. Why? Because the Manageable Scope score is a 1, making it a terrible candidate for a *first* pilot. The "Fraud Alert System" is the winner because it provides the best balance of high impact, visibility, and feasibility. It's the strategic sweet spot.
